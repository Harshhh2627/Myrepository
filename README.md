Data Collection and Preprocessing: Acquired and cleaned a dataset from reputable medical sources, ensuring data quality and consistency. Applied techniques such as normalization and handling missing values.
Feature Engineering: Extracted meaningful features from the dataset, including statistical metrics and domain-specific features to improve model performance.
Algorithm Selection and Model Training: Implemented and compared various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Networks using libraries such as Scikit-learn
Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Used Confusion Matrix for providing accuracy 
Visualization and Reporting: Created visualizations to represent data distributions and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and documentation
